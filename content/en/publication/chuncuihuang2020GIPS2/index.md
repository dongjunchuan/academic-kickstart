abstract: "Biological functions of N-glycans are frequently related to their unique branching patterns. Multistage mass spectrometry (MS<sup>n</sup>) has become the primary method for glycan structural analysis. However, selection of the best fragment as the precursor for the next round of product-ion scanning is important but difficult. We have previously proposed the concept and designed the approach of glycan intelligent precursor selection (GIPS) to guide MS<sup>n</sup> experiments, but its use in N-glycans is not straightforward as some N-glycans are of high similarity in branching patterns. In the present work we introduced new elements to GIPS to improve its performance in N-glycan branching pattern analysis. These include a hypothesis and significance test, based on Bayes factor, and DPbiased as a new precursor selection strategy. The improved GIPS was successfully applied to identification of individual N-glycans, and incorporated into MALDI-MS N-glycan profiling for assignment of N-glycans obtained from glycoproteins and complex human serum."
